# matplotlib_pubplots
Library of matplotlibrc files so one can quickly switch between publication-ready plots and powerpoint-ready plots

The plan:
Have a series of matplotlibrc files, then have a shell script sym-link them into a directory and re-run plot generation code for each rc file, thus generating a directories for "publication_two_column", "powerpoint", "thumbnail", etc.
